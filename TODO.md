## üéØ Next Priority Features

### Production-Safe Branching ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Enable safe production branching for migration testing and dev databases with real data

- [x] PostgreSQL connection utilities in DockerManager
  - Added `execSQL()` method to run queries in containers
  - Handles connection errors gracefully using Bun.spawn
- [x] Application-consistent snapshots using pg_backup_start/pg_backup_stop
  - Implemented coordinated backup workflow
  - Creates ZFS snapshot while Postgres is in backup mode
  - Ensures zero data loss and consistency
  - Compatible with PostgreSQL 15+ (pg_backup_*) and < 15 (pg_start_backup)
- [x] Make consistent snapshots the default for `bpg branch`
  - `bpg branch prod dev` uses pg_backup_start by default
  - ~2-5 second operation (acceptable for production)
- [x] Add `--fast` flag for crash-consistent snapshots (dev/test only)
  - `bpg branch prod dev --fast` skips pg_backup_start
  - Faster but requires WAL replay on startup
  - Documented when to use vs avoid
- [x] Update integration tests to verify consistent snapshots
  - Added tests 8, 8a, 8b to verify both snapshot types
  - All 25 tests passing
- [x] Document production branching best practices
  - Migration testing workflow
  - Performance impact (2-5s)
  - Automated snapshot scheduling via cron

### Namespace-based CLI (v0.2.0) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Restructure CLI to use `<database>/<branch>` namespace pattern for clarity

- [x] Update data model to use namespace structure
- [x] Implement `bpg db` command group (create, list, get, delete, rename)
- [x] Implement `bpg branch` command group (create, list, get, delete, rename, sync)
- [x] Update lifecycle commands to use namespaces (start, stop, restart)
- [x] Update integration tests for namespace syntax
- [x] Create CLAUDE.md documentation
- [x] Delete old unused command files (cleanup)
- [x] Update README.md with namespace examples

### Production Hardening (v0.3.1) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Fix critical architectural issues for production readiness

- [x] State file corruption prevention with fsync
  - Added atomic writes with fsync to prevent data loss on crash
  - Added directory fsync to ensure rename is persisted
  - Guarantees crash-safe state updates
- [x] Stale lock detection and recovery
  - Automatically detects and removes locks from dead processes
  - Uses process.kill(pid, 0) to check if lock holder is alive
  - Prevents permanent lockouts from crashed processes
- [x] Rollback on partial failures
  - Created Rollback utility class for transaction-like cleanup
  - Automatically cleans up ZFS datasets, Docker containers, and snapshots on failure
  - Prevents resource leaks from failed operations
- [x] Dynamic port allocation via Docker
  - Removed manual port tracking (nextPort field)
  - Use port 0 to let Docker assign available ports
  - Automatically reclaims ports when containers are removed
  - No more port exhaustion issues
- [x] ZFS dataset naming consistency
  - Added zfsDatasetName field to Branch interface
  - Eliminates fragile string extraction from full paths
  - Single source of truth for dataset names
- [x] Automatic state migration
  - Migrates old state files on first load
  - Removes deprecated nextPort field
  - Populates zfsDatasetName for existing branches
- [x] New test scripts
  - test-rollback.sh - Verifies resource cleanup on failures
  - test-stale-lock.sh - Tests lock recovery from dead processes

### WAL Archiving & Point-in-Time Recovery (v0.3.0) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Enable continuous archiving and recovery to any point in time

- [x] WAL archiving setup and configuration
  - Configured PostgreSQL archive_mode and archive_command in DockerManager
  - Local WAL archive directory structure at `/var/lib/betterpg/wal-archive/<dataset>/`
  - Per-branch WAL archive isolation
- [x] WAL archive monitoring and management
  - WALManager tracks archive size, file count, and age
  - `bpg wal info [branch]` - Show WAL archive status
  - `bpg wal cleanup <branch> --days <n>` - Clean up old WAL files
  - Verify WAL archive integrity with gap detection
- [x] Snapshot management for PITR
  - `bpg snapshot create <db>/<branch> --label <name>` - Create manual snapshot
  - `bpg snapshot list [branch]` - List all snapshots
  - `bpg snapshot delete <snapshot-id>` - Delete snapshot
  - Snapshots stored in state with metadata (timestamp, label, size)
- [x] Point-in-time recovery (PITR) implementation
  - `bpg branch create <db>/<name> --pitr <timestamp>` - Branch from specific point in time
  - Automatically finds best snapshot before recovery target
  - Replays WAL logs from snapshot to target time
  - Support timestamp formats (ISO 8601, relative like "2 hours ago")
- [x] Recovery configuration
  - Creates recovery.signal and postgresql.auto.conf
  - Configures restore_command and recovery_target_time
  - Uses source branch's WAL archive for replay
- [x] Testing and validation
  - Snapshot commands working (create, list, delete)
  - PITR auto-find snapshot logic implemented
  - Known limitation: Recovery target must be AFTER snapshot creation time

**Architecture Notes:**
- Uses ZFS snapshots as base backups (instant, space-efficient)
- WAL archiving enables replay from snapshot time to recovery target
- Each branch has its own WAL archive directory
- Snapshots are application-consistent (uses pg_backup_start/stop)
- PITR branches use crash-consistent snapshots + WAL replay for consistency

**Known Limitations:**
- Cannot recover to a time BEFORE the latest snapshot
- Users must create snapshots regularly (via cron) to enable fine-grained PITR
- Similar to Neon's approach: regular snapshots define recovery window

## üêõ Known Issues & Fixed Bugs

### Fixed in v0.3.3 & v0.3.4
- [x] Variable hoisting bug in branch create (createdSnapshot declared after use)
- [x] PostgreSQL backup mode session issue
  - pg_backup_start/stop required same session but each execSQL created new session
  - Fixed by replacing with CHECKPOINT command for crash-consistent snapshots
  - Applied to both branch create and branch sync commands
- [x] Test coverage gaps - Added 49 new tests (36 V1 + 13 advanced)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI cleanup step required sudo for file removal

### Current Known Issues
- Branch rename and database rename commands not yet implemented (return "not implemented" message)
- PITR full end-to-end testing not included in CI (too timing-dependent, requires WAL archiving over time)

## üìù Notes

### Testing on macOS
Since ZFS is Linux-only, development requires VPS:
1. SSH to VPS: `ssh betterpg`
2. Pull changes: `cd ~/betterpg && git pull`
3. Build: `~/.bun/bin/bun run build`
4. Test: `./scripts/integration-test.sh`

### VPS Details
- Provider: Hetzner/DigitalOcean
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04
- ZFS pool: `tank` (10GB file-backed)
- Access: `ssh betterpg`

### Current Test Results (v0.3.4)
**All 70 tests passing!** ‚úÖ

**Test Suites:**
1. **Extended tests** (21 tests) - `./scripts/run-extended-tests.sh`
   - Core functionality and lifecycle commands
2. **V1 tests** (36 tests) - `./scripts/run-v1-tests.sh`
   - Comprehensive coverage of all implemented features
   - Database, branch, snapshot, WAL commands
   - Edge cases and error handling
3. **Advanced tests** (13 tests) - `./scripts/run-advanced-tests.sh`
   - Branch sync functionality
   - State integrity and ZFS/Docker integration
   - Complete cleanup verification

**GitHub Actions CI:**
- Runs all 70 tests automatically on push/PR
- Ubuntu 22.04 with ZFS, Docker, PostgreSQL
- View results: https://github.com/elitan/betterpg/actions

### Production Use Cases
**Primary workflows:**
1. **Migration Testing** - Branch prod ‚Üí test migration ‚Üí if success apply to prod, if fail destroy and retry
2. **Dev Databases with Real Data** - Give developers prod branches, manually anonymize sensitive data after branching
3. **Multiple branches per day** - 2-5 second impact acceptable

**Key Requirements:**
- Application-consistent snapshots (pg_start_backup/pg_stop_backup)
- Full read-write branches
- Manual branch cleanup only (no auto-deletion)
